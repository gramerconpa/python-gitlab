You can download a PDF version of this book from ResearchGate[^1^], where you can also find the front matter, table of contents, and what's new in the sixth edition[^2^]. Alternatively, you can access a PDF of the fifth edition from Academia.edu[^3^]. Both versions are richly illustrated with photos, diagrams, and maps that enhance your learning experience.
 
Whether you are a student, a teacher, or a general reader interested in marine biology, you will find this book to be an invaluable resource. As one reviewer wrote, "This is the most captivating, accessible, and comprehensive book of its kind" [^3^].
  
In this article, we will give you a brief overview of some of the main topics covered in *Marine Biology: Function, Biodiversity, Ecology* by Jeffrey Levinton. We will also highlight some of the key features that make this book stand out from other marine biology textbooks.
 
## What is marine biology?
 
Marine biology is the scientific study of life in the ocean and other saltwater environments. It is a multidisciplinary field that draws from biology, chemistry, physics, geology, and other sciences to understand the structure and function of marine organisms and ecosystems. Marine biology encompasses a vast diversity of habitats, from coral reefs and kelp forests, to deep sea vents and polar ice caps, and a huge variety of organisms, from microscopic plankton and bacteria, to whales and sharks.
 
## Why is marine biology important?
 
Marine biology is important for many reasons. First of all, the ocean covers more than 70% of the Earth's surface and contains more than 97% of its water. It plays a vital role in regulating the climate, the water cycle, and the carbon cycle. It also provides many ecosystem services, such as food, oxygen, medicine, recreation, and tourism. Secondly, the ocean is home to an estimated 2.2 million species of living organisms, many of which are still undiscovered or poorly known. These organisms have evolved remarkable adaptations to cope with the challenges and opportunities of their environments. They also represent a source of genetic diversity and potential biotechnology applications. Thirdly, the ocean is facing many threats from human activities, such as overfishing, pollution, habitat destruction, invasive species, acidification, and warming. These threats pose serious risks to the health and sustainability of marine life and ecosystems. Therefore, marine biology is essential for understanding and conserving the ocean's biodiversity and function.
 
## What does this book offer?
 
*Marine Biology: Function, Biodiversity, Ecology* by Jeffrey Levinton offers a comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to the field of marine biology. It covers both the basic principles and the current research topics in marine biology. It also emphasizes the ecological and evolutionary aspects of marine life and ecosystems. The book is organized into four parts:
 
- Part I: The Ocean as a Habitat introduces the physical and chemical properties of seawater, the ocean circulation and climate, and the methods and tools used in marine biology.
- Part II: Marine Organisms explores the diversity and evolution of marine life, from viruses and bacteria, to protists and fungi, to plants and animals. It also examines the anatomy, physiology, behavior, and ecology of major groups of marine organisms.
- Part III: Marine Ecosystems describes the structure and function of different types of marine ecosystems, such as intertidal zones, estuaries, coral reefs, continental shelves, open ocean, deep sea, polar regions, and hydrothermal vents. It also discusses the interactions among organisms and their environment in these ecosystems.
- Part IV: Humans and the Sea addresses the impacts of human activities on marine life and ecosystems. It also covers topics such as fisheries management, marine conservation, marine pollution, climate change effects on the ocean, and marine biotechnology.

The book also features many pedagogical aids that enhance your learning experience. These include:

- Learning objectives at the beginning of each chapter that outline what you will learn.
- Key terms highlighted in bold throughout the text that define important concepts.
- Figures and tables that illustrate key points with clear captions that explain their significance.
- Boxed essays that provide additional information or examples on topics related to the main text.
- Review questions at the end of each chapter that test your comprehension and critical thinking skills.
- Suggested readings at the end of each chapter that direct you to further sources of information on specific topics.
- A glossary at the end of the book that lists all key terms with their definitions.
- An index at the end of the book that helps you locate topics quickly.
