In this article, we will review some of the main benefits and drawbacks of using Idecad Structural 7 for your structural engineering projects.
 
## Benefits of Idecad Structural 7
 
- One of the advantages of Idecad Structural 7 is its intuitive user interface that allows you to create and modify structural models easily. You can use parametric objects, smart grids, snaps, and alignment tools to speed up your modeling process. You can also import and export models from other BIM software such as Revit, ArchiCAD, Tekla Structures, etc.[^2^]
- Another benefit of Idecad Structural 7 is its powerful structural analysis engine that can handle complex and large-scale projects. The engine can support multiple 64-bit cores for analysis optimization and perform both Eigen Analysis and Ritz Analysis[^2^]. You can also perform dynamic analysis, nonlinear analysis, pushover analysis, buckling analysis, seismic analysis, wind analysis, etc.[^2^]
- A third benefit of Idecad Structural 7 is its comprehensive structural design and detailing capabilities. You can design concrete elements according to various codes such as ACI 318, Eurocode 2, TS 500, etc. You can also design steel elements according to AISC 360, Eurocode 3, TS 648, etc. You can also design steel connections according to AISC 360-16 ASD/LRFD or Eurocode 3[^2^]. You can also generate detailed drawings and reports for your structural elements and connections[^2^].

## Drawbacks of Idecad Structural 7

- One of the drawbacks of Idecad Structural 7 is its high price compared to some of its competitors. The software costs $4,500 for a single license and $9,000 for a network license. This might be too expensive for some small or medium-sized firms or individual engineers.
- Another drawback of Idecad Structural 7 is its limited customer support and documentation. The software has a help center that provides some tutorials and videos on how to use the software, but it does not have a live chat or phone support option. The software also does not have a user forum or community where you can ask questions or share tips with other users.
- A third drawback of Idecad Structural 7 is its lack of integration with some popular software such as AutoCAD or SketchUp. The software can import and export models from other BIM software such as Revit or ArchiCAD[^2^], but it does not have a direct link with AutoCAD or SketchUp. This might limit your workflow options if you use these software frequently.

## Conclusion
 
Idecad Structural 7 is a powerful and intuitive software for structural engineering that offers many features and benefits for designing, analyzing, and detailing structural systems. However, it also has some drawbacks such as its high price, limited customer support, and lack of integration with some popular software. Therefore, you should weigh the pros and cons of using this software before deciding whether it suits your needs and budget.
